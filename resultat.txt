('When I received this iPhone 5s (on claims that it was Grade A), I expected it to be a little cleaner and less scratched from its retailer. The phone was pretty grubby and although didn't have any scratches on the actual screen, did have many scratches in its actual bodywork, on its back and sides. You'd never know it has these if you get a complete cover for it though. There's also a small stain that surrounds the camera which ironically shows that it has had a cover on it before (so why it has metallic scratches on its body, who knows?) The phone doesn't look like it's been well taken care of in its previous holdings although the complimentary screen protector was a really nice addition to the sale- it saved me from buying one.I did shop around before purchasing this item and this was the cheapest iPhone 5s, with 32GB, on the market (literally anywhere online.) The battery is very good (literally as new) and the memory is as expected for Apple, just less than 32GB (with about 26GB actually accessible for apps, music etc.)If this phone breaks in the next year/ few years (thanks, inevitable planned obsolescence!) then I think I'll feel comfortable replacing it through this retailer again. Would like it to be a little less grubby when it gets to me next time though (all it needed was an microfibre cloth running over it- not an alcohol wipe because those can damage the phone's coating.)Read full review...

('iPhones are great. They're fast, they're well supported, you can find all sorts of user tips and tricks on the internet. They feel solid and look nice. The only drawback is how frustrating iTunes is. I always thought of an iPhone as being an iPod touch with a SIM card. They were always synonymous with music. However the music seems to be the worst and least stable feature of the iPhone. Syncing is terrible, blutooth audio frequently drops out (where phone calls don't) and worst of all Apple Music causes glitches that can prevent you playing music. They have all the bells and whistles done right, but some of the fundamentals are lacking sorely.Read full review...

Battery life is a little better than the 5 / 5S but still needs regular charging every other day, though I guess that's down to how much you use it during the day.

('UPGRADED FROM A IPHONE 6 TO THIS IPHONE X AND HAS MORE MEMORY THEN MY PREVIOUS IPHONE. LIKE THE FACE  ID BUT DONT LIKE HOW MANY TIMES IT LIGHTS UP WHEN YOU MOVE THE PHONE THATS MY ONLY DOWNSIDE. FROM THE INTERNET I GOT HOW TO KEEP SCREEN BRIGHT AS IT IS HIDDEN IN SETTINGS SO THIS IPHONE KEPT LOWERING SCREEN BRIGHTNESS TO SAVE BATTERY POWER BUT I LIKE MY PHONE TO STAY BRIGHT.ALSO LIKE THE WIRELESS CHARGING SO DONT HAVE TO KEEP PUTTING A LEAD INTO IT SO JUST PUT IT ONTO A CHARGING PAD AND IT CHARGES WIRELESS.SO THIS HAS A LOT MORE FEATURES THEN MY LAST IPHONE AND SLOWLY FINDING OUT THESE NEW ONES. SCREEN SIZE IS GOOD AND AGAIN PHOTOS CAN BE TAKEN IN 4K BUT YOU HAVE TO SET THIS AGAIN HIDDEN IN SETTINGS. MAINLY WHEN I WANT TO FIND SOMETHING OUT ABOUT THIS IPHONE I GO TO THE INTERNET AND SO FAR BEEN ABLE TO FIND THE ANSWER .

('Construction and materials are superb and the screen is the best iPhone display so far. Face ID is a well integrated and functional alternative to a fingerprint sensor. The iOS operating system is IMHO still the most professional UI available on any phone. Having an almost edge to edge screen and no touch sensor combines to make a very compact handset, especially considering it has a 5.8 inch display.To sum up, it's great to hold and great to use but is it expensive? Yes, but the Samsung flagships aren't that far behind and iPhone's have in general a habit in working really well so highly recommended and worth every penny.Read full review...

('I have had several Android phones since my iphone 6+ last year. I have never been totally happy so bit the bullet and paid a fair chunk of money for this iphone x 256Gb phone.

('I have been using the iPhone X for the past 2 years. Overall I love the Face ID feature and makes the phone an incredibly smooth experience (for unlocking, overall app logins and different features). It is very easy to get used to the 'new' way to use your iPhone (due to the lack of Home button) and returning to a previous version of the iPhone (iPhone 8 and before) feels clunky. The battery doesn't seem to have suffer too much, after 2 years of use, my battery health seems to be at 93% of maximum capacity (from the iOS settings). I really like the overall design of the phone. Having said that, I take very good care of my electronics (especially if they cost me close to a grand) and there is no scratches on my phone. But I have seen many other people with the same model phone with a cracked screen/back plate (which is not a good aesthetic) I haven't felt the need to upgrade since I got this phone and don't think I will any time soon (as the newer version of this phone are just more powerful version of an already powerful phone).

('I was using an iPhone 6S and it had a broken screen and was slowing down in all sorts of ways. I was saving up to get one of the newest iPhones when I read an article in Apple News suggesting that anyone in my position should consider getting a 7 or 7 Plus instead as you could still get brand new models on eBay at a big saving.I am so glad I took the advice because I now have a brand new phone with double the memory of my old one (& double the amount that you can now buy from Apple), a better quality (& condition!) screen and a battery that is at 100% capacity and performance. It does everything much quicker than my old phone and takes much better photos as well. This phone will do me at least until Apple bring out a 5G model and maybe even after that.Oh and best of all it saved me PS200 compared with a new 7 Plus from Apple that would have had half as much memory or PS425 compared with an XR with the same memory and PS675 - 775 compared with an XS. I am not saying it is as good a phone as those models, but it is pretty damn close and much, much better value for money. I think that's what you call a no brainer!Read full review...

('The prosThe phone arrived well ahead of the expected date. It was easy to operate and a lot bigger than my previous iPhone. As previously stated in other reviews, the screen is large but that only becomes "obvious" when you have to carry the mobile in your pocket.The phone had no visible marks on the casing and arrived with its charger and headphones. It would have been nice if we had a pin to remove the tray for the sine card but I improvised using a safety pin.I love how fast the apps open and the speed with which you can switch between them.The consThe battery life drains quite easily. But the phone will give me a likely  time when the battery will be completely drained.If you don't have many apps running at once, the battery does last longer. Though I've always charged my mobile everyday.There is also a nearly daily prompt to update the software. I can't cancel it or stop it which is really annoying.But overall I love it.Read full review...

('I bought this phone primarily for the 23M pixel Sony camera which has turned out to be a disappointment. The pictures have a lot of noise and there are strange artifacts which appear to be caused by too much sharpening. A quick google of these problems reveals that other keen photographers have noticed the same problem and Sony do not appear to be fixing it. I've tried using 3rd party camera apps with no improvement in picture quality. The picture quality on my previous Samsung Galaxy S5 was better.The rest of the phone is good. The screen is nice, the case has a solid feel, the fingerprint scanner is reliable and works well, battery life for me is 2-3 days (I don't use the phone a lot), sound quality using proper Senheiser headphones is good. Radio performance is about average - it drops calls in the same places my Galaxy S5 drops calls.Overall it's a good phone but with a camera that is over-hyped by Sony. If you are not a keen photographer then you will proabably not notice the shortcomings in the camera - this is a great phone for you. If however you are a keen photographer then look elsewhere - you will be disappointed by the noisy grainy detail in photos.Read full review...

('This is my first smartphone and because I am a skinflint, it is an old, unlocked model. I wanted a phone which fitted in my pocket like all the other phones, so its size is perfect for me. Because it is a 4s, it has Siri which is a really efficient voice recognition system that allows you to speak to write texts etc. I was pretty quick with ordinary keypads, but the touch-sensitive little one on the iPhone 4s slowed me right up. I tried out Siri with a text, not thinking it would work properly, but it is really good, and doesn't need to be introduced to the talker.I am still feeling my way around the world of iPhones, but I am getting used to it pretty quickly. I have always used Macs, so I sort of understand their way of designing things. At 65 years old, I have left it a bit late to be of any use in most reviews on these products, but this could be to someone like me, buying an old model.The worst thing about these 4s is the battery life. You can actually watch the power drain when using them, 45%...40%...35%... and I was so shocked that I had to go to the net to see if this was normal or not. It is, but I am told the later models (6s) are not so bad. I am not so sure you could watch an hour's worth of video on it without draining it completely, and sometimes it refuses to take a charge. I am also having difficulty syncing it with my desktop, but that could just be me.Apart from that it's a great little phone and I like it a lot.Read full review...

('If you know exactly what you are buying, a Grade A used iPhone 4s is great value for money, and probably the best phone out there that you can still buy at this size if you are looking for a compact smartphone.The software will feel slow if you are used to a newer phone - this is not a phone to rely your computer tasks on (personally, I find my tablet to be better for that). It won't run heavy games. But it's more than perfect to get the basic done - social media, messaging apps, phone calls, quick searches... As far as phone cameras go, this one is great.The battery life isn't great, but neither is the battery life of any other smartphone I've used.Another factor to consider, if you will be moving your files a lot or if you find it important to be able to customize your phone, is that Apple products aren't ideal for either of those. As someone who won't be relying on my phone for anything important that doesn't bother me, but I would otherwise be hesitant - I have always valued the freedom you have on Android to do anything you want.Another annoying thing about iPhones is how incompatible Apple make their products to any other brands - basic features that should work between different phones, such as bluetooth or tethering, won't work with anything but Apple. The charging port isn't standard. If you decide to switch to Apple, be aware that their products are designed to restrict you to Apple.Lastly, iPhone screens are very fragile (smartphone screens in general are not at all dependable). I would recommend getting a screen protector and a flip case as soon as you get your phone. If you're careful, it will scratch. If you're not careful, it WILL smash. If you're anything like me and manage to keep dropping your phone despite your attempts to be careful, you'll be glad you only spent PS65 on this one. (That's the main reason why I decided to change my attitude towards phones - wasting so much money on changing them yearly was giving me grief. The less you spend on a phone, the less you'll regret it when it breaks.)All in all, this phone is definitely worth buying if you want a cheap little phone that will be great if you don't want to rely on it and won't give you grief if it breaks.Read full review...

('A really great phone with all the features you could ever want. I purchased this phone to replace my HTC Desire HD which I found a little large to carry around in my pocket. The first thing I noticed about the Apple 4S was the quality of build and a size that fits perfectly in your hand, the screen is amazingly clear and the colours are very vibrant. The installed apps are great and with many to choose to add on from the apps store starting at just 69p, calls are clear and have no drop off. The introduction of "Siri" in this model makes a big difference and is extremely easy to use, battery life on standby is excellent and under heavy use still performed well, the only thing I did not like is that the battery is not replaceable.Overall I would highly recommend this phone.Read full review...

('I bought this phone for my wife as I am an Android guy myself. Coming from iPhone 3G the iPhone 4S was a leap of course on every aspect. I liked the new slim industrial-look design. The screen resolution, clarity and brightness is amazing, shame Apple didn't decide to exceed 3.5" yet. The 8MP camera and the snappy no latency shooting is impressive. Pulldown menu, which for some reason reminds you of Android :), is a great addition to iOS 5.0 but lacking more functionality like accessing running apps, sms, email ...etc through their notifications. Battery life is the worst thing next to the lack of long awaited Jailbreak for new A4 based idevices.Read full review...

('I love my iphone, I have never had one before and was reluctant but gave in to my kids and it is amazing, I only have the 4s which has been out a long time, I just wanted to make sure i was going to get on with it first, having said that I will at some point upgrade, the only down side i find is that I have to make sure I take my charger with me as it does not seem to last the day I am a builder so it is not always easy to find a socket when I am working and I cant charge it in the van unless I am sitting in it as I have to leave the keys in the ignition which is somewhat annoying, I am lead to believe that the newer ones are better, I do hope soRead full review...

('I've bought this iPhone as a "Grade A - used" product, but when I've opened the box I found a brand new phone inside. Actually, there are some just noticeable metal bits on the sides, but the whole stuff looks like new. The battery life is excellent (depends on usage, but sometimes up to 2-3 days), the operating speed is perfect, also with iOS7. I'm not sure if the home button doesn't work properly, or just I'm a noob - but sometimes I have to push it 2 or 3 times to get the home screen. It's an iOS7 problem, that the iTunes crashes sometimes, but if you google on it, you can find many solutions to solve it.Despite these small problems, this is a very good gear and I'm sure about not buying anything else but iPhone.Read full review...

('I held on to my Note 3 until it literally started to look like a door stop, I sold it (amazed that it was STILL worth hundreds) and upgraded to the Note 4.Good GOD what a phone, in the year between the 3 and the 4, Samsung  did what other company blurb PRETENDS to do (listen to the fans) and made small improvements to everything. What they made is a timeless piece of smart phone that still kills years later. The battery woes on the forums are garbage, do you have to charge it every day? Of course. Does it drain if you have every function on and working 24/7? Of course. Does it struggle signal-wise if you live in a lead box or underground? Of course. What phone doesn't?In fact, the only improvements that ANY phone seems to be able to do these days is give you a BILLION megapixel camera for the endless selfies with hot chocolate. Do you REALLY need a massive camera for a picture of your lunch? Of course you don't.So stupidity aside, this thing has masses of space, has a screen that simply cannot be beaten in my opinion- and YES I've seen other phones, and yes I realise if you go looking you'll find minor flaws- like if you have the brightness set to 'surface of the sun', and the screen time-out set to 'the end of time', there's gonna be some screen burn after three years. If you handle it like a TONKA toy it's going to show wear, but other than that this thing is a slice of fried Gold.There's a reason Samsung out-sells iPhones, there's a reason iPhones devalue 10 times faster than Samsungs, and the Note range is it.I mean, the Company pulled an entire line (Note 7) even on the off-chance the batteries had a fault (the number of ACTUAL battery problems weren't even double figures, iPhone fires are in the MULTIPLE HUNDREDS!- but then with the follow up note 8 they STILL out sell iPhones 3 to 1!The support is faultless, the stability is awesome, the slim design makes it feel like the whole thing is just the screen, even with thick cases it is STILL a thin phone.Finally, the fingerprint scanner is a sensor on the home button, and this gets a lot of bad press- I have no idea why, it works EVERY time, sure if you've been in the pool for a month it will struggle (there's a secondary password, and tertiary pin for this type of thing) or if you don't wash it will judge you and have none-of-it.#Pros: Much better speaker, amazing screen, beautiful design, flawless quality.Cons: I don't have two heads so I can buy two.Note, heed these words: buy a screen protector, and a case that covers the edge- in three years when you get 80-90% of what you paid for it back when you sell it second hand- you'll thank me.Read full review...

Also there would not be any software updates I already knew that there were no future updates planned for this phone model.I made the decision that if it was a brand new unlocked phone which indeed it is it was still worth it but there are difficulties /no warranty with it.

('We live in peculiar times, when there is so hard to find a premium, well-built, powerful phone that would be of a reasonable size (easily manageable with a single hand - this has always been a key consideration for me). Yet it looks like Sony Experia Z5 Compact is pretty close to this ideal. It basically ticks all the boxes in terms of quality and performance, and battery holds almost the entire day, with quite intense usage. There are a couple of downsides - the fingerprint scanner does not always work, when plugging in headphones it sometimes behaves weirdly, and it comes packed with Sony bloatware, some of which you can never get rid of the normal way. Yet these are all tiny details - overall after a month of heavy testing I can give it full marks with clear conscience.Read full review...

Then i was recommended this product and never looked back. Battery life is awesome. I use it for whatsapp, snapchat and a bit of Instagram. I always have data on and also wifi most of the day. Battery lasts me 2-3 days. One thing to make note of is that you must use the original charger provided direct without extension leads for the best performance. Camera is very good quality but not as amazing as I expected, not as quick as my iPod touch which can just snap 10 pictures in a row so not amazing for everyday snaps but great for stunning scenic pictures. It was hard for me to get used to the operating system of sony which is new to me but im finally adapting. Fingerprint sensor is great and i treat this as a bonus since it doesn't work when my finger or the phones is cold or when my finger is damp or dirty, works in most situations for me. It took me about  a week to set up the sensor properly because you need to register the fingerprints and i kept adding and changing the finger position.Read full review...
