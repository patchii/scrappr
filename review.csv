Beware this may be a used phone pretending to be a new one	1.0 out of 5 stars	I would put a zero star rating if allowed.  I bought this a gift| only to find that during set up that the iPhone had already been owned by 2 other people with their IDs still hidden in the phone.  Apple support that nothing can be done to remove them from the phone without the password for those accounts - clearly that is never going to happen.  So I am now going to have to take this gift back and send it back to Amazon.  Hardly Christmas.  Completely unacceptable.
A solid phone| but an eyewatering price	4.0 out of 5 stars	It's a truly great phone| at a grossly inflated price. You would be foolish if you didn't think a large amount of what you are paying for is branding. Yes - you do get a lot of tech with this. And I find that even though some other phones are technically superior the iPhone seems to run better HOWEVER this is nearly one thousand pounds. That is a big investment - more than a laptop. If you can afford it| it won't disappoint but it's defiantly not that much better than the older versions which are 2/3 of the price.
Great brand new iPhone !	5.0 out of 5 stars	Really good iPhone ! Arrived way earlier than expected so quite pleased. The phone is brand new and is just amazing !
It’s a legit unopened I Phone X.	5.0 out of 5 stars	When I ordered this I was a bit skeptical due to the reviews. It arrived earlier than expected. It’s a legitimate I Phone X| not a fake or refurbished one. It also comes with headphones and a charger.
Genuine iPhone x	5.0 out of 5 stars	I received a genuine iPhone X| I was initially worried but on a second thought plus reviews; I decided to go for it. No disappointment| brand new phone and no problem.  Amazon called me to verify before authorising my purchase| even more better and more importantly cheap price I could get.
Excellent customer service	5.0 out of 5 stars	supplier is amazing. Received this phone before the due date which was amazing. Phone was brandnew unlocked in it’s original packaging:-) Phone is good but don’t think apple is worth the price tag in what it actually is.
Great phone at a decent price.	5.0 out of 5 stars	Purchased for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. Arrived quickly and although it was a grade A used item| couldn't find a mark on it!12 month warranty gives peace of mind too.
iPhoneX| at good price - love it.	5.0 out of 5 stars	It's an iPhoneX| at good price - love it.
Five Stars	5.0 out of 5 stars	absolute bargain for the iphone 10  also arrived really quickly
i just cost too much	2.0 out of 5 stars	review after 2 monththe iphone xs overall doesnt really have much new except the full screen and with fingerprint over the screen. the phone runs smooth so far  just like other iphones i got before. but i know it will slow later on and with full storage problem probably. so far so happy with it. the battery can last slightly longer than my iphone 8 but not much.a friend of mine bought a huawei p20 at black Friday while i bought the iphone| his phone runs great so far and ive tried as well| both of the phone are really similar however huawei p20 got a better camera.the price ive paid for the iphone is double compare to my friends one| i do recom the price for the iphone is too expensive nowday| so value for money i would only gonna to rate 1 star
Absolutely beautiful	5.0 out of 5 stars	I'm really happy so far. The camera is stunning. The portrait mode is great with the dynamic blurring in the background| and the ability to take lowlight photos now makes me really happy.The battery life lasts more than a day with me watching netflix and prime video all day which is really surprising.The facial recognition is absolutely great. Cold weather + gloves| not a problem anymore! Touchless payments is also great to have if I forget my wallet at home. Haven't had a single issue so far. Very fluid OS.The ONLY nuance is if you want to listen to music or something and charge your phone| which you can't do unless you either buy a wireless charger or use bluetooth earphones. Or you risk it and buy a 3rd party adapter to charge and use earphones but I don't feel comfortable doing that.Really useful having the 256GB. Overall a happy customer :) and great experience from Amazon as usual. Delivered next day
Over heating	2.0 out of 5 stars	The phone is overheating after a little use. Need to get it looked at because this should not be happening to a £900+ phone.
Iphone X at a more acceptable price	5.0 out of 5 stars	Well pleased with my purchase at a more sensible price. The phone was never| in my view| worth the original asking price of £999. But still a excellent phone never the less. It is a brand new unit that so far has proven to be faultless. Delivered in real fast time too. You can find them a little cheaper| but this is a good buy.
iPhone at a great price	5.0 out of 5 stars	Really happy with my purchase at a great price. I was a bit sceptical first buying a apple product on amazon but everything went fine and the phone is great
iPhone x	5.0 out of 5 stars	Very happy with the iPhone X its fast it’s camera is really good| I like everything about it
Great phone	5.0 out of 5 stars	Came pretty quickly and in good condition. Didn’t come with earphones for hygiene reasons which is understandable but did have everything else. No problems with the phone so far.
Excellent	5.0 out of 5 stars	I was most impressed by the condition of this phone - It was truly immaculate! Yes Battery was down to 96% of capacity but it is a used phone and the battery life is still way better than I was used to. Thanks very much! HIghly recommended!
Great phone	5.0 out of 5 stars	Great product and fast shipping
G	5.0 out of 5 stars	This is my 6th iPhone and in my opinion is the best yet. It took a little while to get used to using it compared to my iPhone 6s with no home button but comes naturally after a while. Photo quality is great as well and the battery life seems to last much longer.
Buy now from this company	5.0 out of 5 stars	Thank you| great company| had problem with charger| sorted the next day
iPhone x	2.0 out of 5 stars	Received the iPhone X 6 days ago already had to replace the charger and had nothing but problems internally as well as with the screen. A trip to apple is a must.
Very happy !	5.0 out of 5 stars	Quality very good happy customer!
Brand new phone at used price	5.0 out of 5 stars	Upgraded from an 8plus| enjoying the one-handed operation. My concernes about Face ID over the previous fingerprint scan were unfounded| I adapted quickly. Otherwise the quality of phone is as you would expect from Apple
Amazing	5.0 out of 5 stars	Wonderful product and service| I highly recommend this phone
