Upgraded from an iPhone 7 so this is a decent upgrade. Phone is fast and battery life is good. Face ID is extremely cool and the removal of the home button is easy to get used to. Best of all though is the camera - it's fantastic. I know it's not the newest iPhone but it compares very favourably with the Xs and Xr in terms of features. Available for very good prices - highly recommendedRead full review...
 I always wanted the iPhone X but was not prepared to pay the full price as I did not think it was worth it so I waited a year until the secondhand ones came on the market, now it's slightly more reasonably priced I have one came in fair condition as described but I think the phone is quite bulky and quite heavy actually especially compared with my iPhone 6 that I traded it for.  Also lack of a home button takes a bit of getting used to you have to swipe in various directions for previously easily to attain functions.Read full review...
In my opinion iPhone X is by far the best iPhone yet with a fast processor, great camera and full screen display. The full screen display means it is more compact that the iPhone 8 and with 64GB of storage is plenty for photos, documents etc. Battery life is reasonable and only needs charging every other day mostly a top-up but depends on usage. Overall I would highly recommend this phone.Read full review...
Great phone fast and screen size makes a big differenceBattery so far also good lasts over 1.5 daysUpgraded from iPhone 6s
I've always had the plus model Iphone - I liked the big screen and the better camera specs. But then the X came along and I'd never go back. If you compare it's screen to that of the 8 plus, the blacks are deep and rich and it seems kinder to the eyes. I've always found the LCD screens intrusive on the vision after a while. It's compact and makes full use of the screen but in a smaller footprint. The sound is outstanding and the camera great - although not as impressive as the Galaxy Note 8, the night shots on the X are poor in comparison.But all in all if your looking for power in a smaller form, this is the phone. Do I think it's worth nearly PS1000 ? No definitely not and that's why I'd always resort to an unlocked one on here!Read full review...
The iPhone X is a completely new generation iPhone, the design is completely changed with 5.8" display on a size significantly smaller then previous versions Plus models, no home button, Face ID, futuristic cameras, and more.Read full review...
It's completely different excellent for a first generation phone. it's a good start I love where apple are headed hopefully they can build it into a marvellous experience like their last decade.
iPhones first design alteration in 3 years! Stunning OLED Super Retina display, advanced facial recognition with the brand new TrueDepth camera system on apples first all screen phone.
Great phone have upgraded from iPhone 7. Lots of new features including face login. Fantastic the screen fills the front of the phone, early days to review the charge but looks good. Camera also good and Animojis are fun to use. Do I miss the home button? Not at all!Great delivery from DPD, I had to change the day as was arriving earlier than expected, easy to swap, thanks guys.Read full review...
The iPhone X made bold promises about how it was a game changer in the iPhone world and everyone on the world was aghast at the notch (yes I know Sharp did it first but did you know that?). It's not at all obtrusive, it is quickly forgotten about and any concern you had about performance can but quickly dismissed as this is a faster phone than previous iterations.It is comfortable to hold, is wireless charging compliant, only at 7.5w but still quicker than older models.The chipset handles running multiple apps with ease, the front and rear cameras produce some great pictures, portrait mode is especially good and it's loud. Sound quality is far superior than some other premium phones.Worth a punt and so pleased I did.Read full review...
Pros: No bezels, amazing OLED display, Face ID and a Portrait mode in the camera app.Fantastic phone.Cons: it's an investment
The best phone ever!! So quick and easy to use!!! People moan about apple and how by buying there phones your contributing to their wealth but they make the best phone! Period!!
I'm about the future I rate this phone best if you have the money disposable then why not buy this
This phone is excellent, I had the iphone 8 plus which I thought was a great phone but I find the iphone x to be more compact faster and easier to use in the hand and I would thoroughly recommend it 
great design and camera with all new display
I guess flawless for the current era of smartphones. Honestly, a great device for the user. A great iPhone experience!
So far, so good. This was an awesome experience from screen, performance, camera and battery life. Everything on the palm of your hand.
I've had my phone for a week now having upgraded from the 7+ and I am very impressed indeed - great screen, easier to hold/use, handy wireless charging and the screen quality is breathtaking 
Excellent battery life and very impressive photo quality. Wireless charging is a great addition and ease of use is massively improved compared with previous iphone models.
Great phone as usual does everything
Great phone. Physically it reminds me a lot of the original iPhone, the size, rounded corners and metal frame around the outside are very reminiscent of the original. The full screen is beautiful too, this is my third bezel-less phone and I can't go back now.Read full review...
Well, we love our iPhones and this one just tops them all:Very good battery life (in comparison with previous iPhones) a very good screen and the cool face recognition..What's not to like?Well I'm missing the 3-D scanning feature!Read full review...
Great phone only negative is with every apple iPhone they are too expensive compared to other brands and when you use iOS it's difficult to go to android due to all photos etc are on the iCloud
Great price for a flagship phone, comes unlocked and ready for action. Have tested the camera in different lighting situations and found it to be very easy to use and adjust for different settings. The phone itself works fine as one would expect and the internet and bluetooth connectivity work seamlessly. Very happy with my purchase.Read full review...
A very good smartphone, great quality sound, good size and a good camera.
Excellent little piece of tech which should meet my needs for some while to come  Easy to use with a big screen  Transferring data and settings from the old I phone was a breeze. Couldn't have been simpler  .  My only slight criticism is that although the battery life is certainly better it still needs charging almost every daysRead full review...
Great phone with screen size basically covering the whole front of the screen but the handset is not too big.. Fast processer and with facial recognition which can also be used on some Apps.
Value for money, hi-spec future proof phone. The screen is amazing and I find myself using the phone more often, doing laptop tasks on my phone due to big HD screen and smooth operating system.Camera is amazing, 64GB storage is adequate for my usage, HD screen is amazing, sound quality superb, additional water resistance is a plus, charges quick too.Read full review...
A superb phone-stunning looks, glass back, wireless charging and long battery life.All for PS220 less than list price. A bargain and amazing camera and low light photos also!
I really appreciate the larger screen, which is so sleek and sensitive. I thought when the iPhone X was introduced that it would be much bigger than I wanted but the overall dimensions are the same as my iPhone 7 with a case on. I love the slide-up feature and don't mind face i.d. because nobody can see it!Read full review...
I've only had my iPhone X for 3 weeks, love it to bits. Very expensive, but then it is like having a computer in one's pocket. It is supposed to be water resistant to a depth of 1 metre, Im not going to try it! The camera is brilliant, lots of new features & of course the facial recognition is a bonus. Read full review...
Great phone had it for a week now and loved every second of using it. Easy to get use to the swiping features but they make it so much easier and I love using them.
Brand new iPhone, arrived at my house within 24 hours of buying, brilliant product
iPhone X is awesome!!! Arrived 3 days early than expected! Perfect condition for a great price !! Defo recommend!!!
Excellent screen, Face ID brilliant and who needs a home button?iPhone just keeps on improving.Expensive for any phone but getting a good used one on eBay offers the best value option.
Thank u so much for sending it so quick for me I am in love with it already and it's so easy to used thank you x
The best ever in phones I ve never had.If I have to say some contras I would say it's a bit heavy and the battery is not much better than previous iPhones
Perfect as described has no issues other than the damaged back which does not effect the operation.
Perfect, handy all about face and display
I upgrade my phone from iPhone 7 Plus to an X and the only thing what's new for me is the Face ID.
Cool phone. Very good camera. Portrait cam. Fast, smaller and lower weight than 7 or 8 plus version.
3 words: Great! Amazing! Fantastic!
The phone is great. Thank you
Very nice
Happy to buy from eBay
Ok is perfect
Honestly the greatest phone of all time
All at the highest level. The phone is wonderful.
iCloud lock??
Good
recommended seller, excellent purchase
Like new
Muchas gracias increiblemente bueno
If you can afford it, it's the best iPhone yet. Long battery life and super HD screen make the phone much better than my old 6s. Wireless charging is also a good addition
My first x was stolen and ended up with a 6 again. It's a relief to have an x again, great battery and quick to respond mostly- well it's still an apple phone so has the odd meltdown ha
Definitely the best phone designed to date and a wonderful user experience. Never fails to amaze me daily.
I'm a Samsung man myself always have been and I'm afraid to say it always will be I made the jump from S7 to iPhone X because the phone looks different from all other iPhone handsets and the look was appealing however I just couldn't get used to the operating system of the iPhone so I ended selling the handset for the s9, otherwise I would definitely recommend the phoneRead full review...
Great phone, I got it at a good price, wouldn't have paid anymore though, works well, would recommend. 
Like a new lease of life
Great phone and very reliable 
Great phone . Thank you 
It's very nice phone
Recommended for all ppl. This is your life with new technology in future lifestyles. Handle your self with anything all your lifestyle system with the new technology iPhone X, unlike any other phones or iPhones has come before.Read full review...
Took about two weeks to come but worth it
No communication at all and no updates?
Brings back the magic of the first iPhones, advanced technology, groundbreaking design, stunning screan and the most intuitive OS.
Very reliable and suitable for a business fone
Best iPhone to date
Great value for phone. Excellent seller
UPGRADED FROM A IPHONE 6 TO THIS IPHONE X AND HAS MORE MEMORY THEN MY PREVIOUS IPHONE. LIKE THE FACE  ID BUT DONT LIKE HOW MANY TIMES IT LIGHTS UP WHEN YOU MOVE THE PHONE THATS MY ONLY DOWNSIDE. FROM THE INTERNET I GOT HOW TO KEEP SCREEN BRIGHT AS IT IS HIDDEN IN SETTINGS SO THIS IPHONE KEPT LOWERING SCREEN BRIGHTNESS TO SAVE BATTERY POWER BUT I LIKE MY PHONE TO STAY BRIGHT.ALSO LIKE THE WIRELESS CHARGING SO DONT HAVE TO KEEP PUTTING A LEAD INTO IT SO JUST PUT IT ONTO A CHARGING PAD AND IT CHARGES WIRELESS.SO THIS HAS A LOT MORE FEATURES THEN MY LAST IPHONE AND SLOWLY FINDING OUT THESE NEW ONES. SCREEN SIZE IS GOOD AND AGAIN PHOTOS CAN BE TAKEN IN 4K BUT YOU HAVE TO SET THIS AGAIN HIDDEN IN SETTINGS. MAINLY WHEN I WANT TO FIND SOMETHING OUT ABOUT THIS IPHONE I GO TO THE INTERNET AND SO FAR BEEN ABLE TO FIND THE ANSWER . YES PRICE IS DEAR FOR THE NORMAL PERSON AND WILL BE A WHILE BEFORE I THINK OF GETTING A NEWER PHONE AS THIS ONE WILL HAVE TO EARN ITS PRICE I PAID.Read full review...
Construction and materials are superb and the screen is the best iPhone display so far. Face ID is a well integrated and functional alternative to a fingerprint sensor. The iOS operating system is IMHO still the most professional UI available on any phone. Having an almost edge to edge screen and no touch sensor combines to make a very compact handset, especially considering it has a 5.8 inch display.To sum up, it's great to hold and great to use but is it expensive? Yes, but the Samsung flagships aren't that far behind and iPhone's have in general a habit in working really well so highly recommended and worth every penny.Read full review...
I have had several Android phones since my iphone 6+ last year. I have never been totally happy so bit the bullet and paid a fair chunk of money for this iphone x 256Gb phone. Yes it is VERY expensive but rightly so. Everything just works as usual with Apple. Bluetooth audio in my car works brilliantly with my 21000+ songs in my library. Face unlock really works glasses on or off. Yep I am very happy.Read full review...
I have been using the iPhone X for the past 2 years. Overall I love the Face ID feature and makes the phone an incredibly smooth experience (for unlocking, overall app logins and different features). It is very easy to get used to the 'new' way to use your iPhone (due to the lack of Home button) and returning to a previous version of the iPhone (iPhone 8 and before) feels clunky. The battery doesn't seem to have suffer too much, after 2 years of use, my battery health seems to be at 93% of maximum capacity (from the iOS settings). I really like the overall design of the phone. Having said that, I take very good care of my electronics (especially if they cost me close to a grand) and there is no scratches on my phone. But I have seen many other people with the same model phone with a cracked screen/back plate (which is not a good aesthetic) I haven't felt the need to upgrade since I got this phone and don't think I will any time soon (as the newer version of this phone are just more powerful version of an already powerful phone). Read full review...
Excellent iphone, a bit expensive admittedly but very easy to use once you use it for a day or 2.Battery life is slightly better than previous iphones but for normal everyday usage it works very well.By far the best iphone Apple have made to date.Read full review...
So far battery life has been great. Face ID isn't as good as I expected but the Xs fixes this apparently. It only works in one orientation. Other than that it's really a pleasure to use when compared to prior iPhones, thanks to the gestures.Read full review...
It's such a good phone iPhone X the camera is excellent, battery life is longer ..
I've always had iPhones , I feel Apple have lift the bar with this new phone . It's a joy to use , having upgrading from the iPhone 7 Plus, I thought its size was  too small at first , I've had the phone a week a now and have now realised how nice this size lives in your pocket . The face recognition works faultlessly . Yes it's expensive , but how many other things do you buy that you look at so much .Read full review...
Unfortunately the battery does not have such a great length of time regarding the price one has to pay for the mobile !
A lot better than IPhone XR, brilliant Screen, very good size
Quality build and performance. FaceID seems to work pretty much all the time - the only downside being lit screen when the phone is inadvertently tilted. The notch is not even noticed, and a small price to pay for being almost bezel less. Still a class leader one year on.Read full review...
Bet iPhone there's ever been, Face ID is so quick easy to use with bright colourful display, fast processor and perfect fit to your hand. You will love it
I was going to sell it on but changed my mind was going to sell it to a recycling company but in the end changed my mind after using it had a few Apple phones but this is the best yet of their phones
Had the iPhone 7 before this, and this phone is far better. Bigger clearer screen and faster to response to commands. Saved a huge amount to buying second hand, and it looks as good as new!!
This iPhone x is the best phone in circulation as of today with all the amazing features. It is very user friendly.
It's SUCH GOOD QUALITY!!its works and looks brand new.Im really happy with what I've got.thank you
A lot of money for this phone which has a brittle screen. My phone slipped of the bed and cracked. I've had other phones which have slipped out of my pocket while running without damage and these phones were a lot cheaper.On another note the camera is superbRead full review...
So having owned an iPhone 7 Plus and watching/reading so many reviews I decided to purchase an iPhone X 256gb Space Grey.Overall it's a great solid premium phone and is a complete different experience to previous iPhones I have owned.No finger print gets some getting used to, but Face ID is good.Would recommend this phone especially the 256gb modelRead full review...
It's hard to fault this iPhone. It really is superb in every way but it is also extremely difficult to justify the price point.
Moved up from iPhone 7 biggest noticeable difference for me is the source quality is loud & clear
Overall a very good product, but significantly overpriced. There are only a few  things that I would like to see changed:1. Make it easier to close an app. The current method involves taking four steps. First, swipe up; then pause and wait for the minus sign to appear; then press it; then swipe the slider to close the app. Apple needs to find a better way.2. Make it easier to close the IPhone. Holding down buttons on both sides of the unit is so awkward that I actually go to settings to close the phone.3. Have four direction keys on the keyboard. Scrolling would be much easier.4. Include a sound mixer to adjust base, mid and treble.5. Make it possible to adjust the size of the icons.There may be more because I just started using it and am still learning.Read full review...
The phones X is really full of technologies which give us the top features like very optimal form factor good quality picture, fast processor speed and lot of memory up to 512gb for super computer ready applications in professional universities research. Lawyers office specialist doctors. Apple working hard in getting Applications developers to port windows applications for personal and professional market on iPhone and IpadRead full review...
Where do i even start? this phone is just simply amazing to use, from the effortless unlocking with face id to the beautiful oled screen to the fast wireless charging and fast cable charging, not to mention that you can pick up a basically brand new one for around $850, i'll start with the battery, it is the best battery i have ever used in an iphone, it easily lasts 12 hours with moderate use and i've even pushed it to 15 on low power mode, that combined with fast wireless charging means i don't even have to think about charging it, just plunk it down on the wireless charger before bed wake up with a fully charged battery rinse and repeat. the screen is also the best i've ever seen on an iphone, everything is super crisp and surprisingly colour accurate for an oled, compared to samsung's super saturated screens it is great. also no burn in to speak of whatsoever. the speakers are the best on any iPhone i've ever owned only being beat out by my iPad pro, they get super loud and pack a surprising amount of punch for their size. the cameras are also simply put amazing, i get perfect low light shots and vibrant daytime shots, along with portrait mode for the front and rear cameras and 4k 60 video you can't go wrong. as for looks this is as good as it gets, this phone is simply beautiful, from the shiny glass back to the nearly bezel-less screen to the stainless steel around the body it is simplistically perfect, i get looks all the time walking down the street with this thing and some people have even stopped me to try it, side note this is the most solid iphone i've ever owner as well, there is no creaks or bumps and it feels like i'm holding something super rigid and solid.  no phone is perfect but this is damn near close to perfection in the phone worldRead full review...
Great Phone pricy lika all Apple products. Very bad charger included thankfully I had a iPad charger. Pretty cheap by Apple since competitive products include fast charger as a standard.
Amazing phone, but at an appropriate high price. Extremely fast, lots of memory, great screen. It's the top of the line iPhone (for now), so what do you expect.
This was my first big purchase off of eBay, which I got during the 10% off deal. I was a bit concerned bc I wasn't sure if it was as reliable as just getting via Apple or Amazon, but so far the phone's been working great!Read full review...
Pros: great looks. , I love the full screen and the online games WOW! Factor!  Super fast A11 chip. The camera is super great!  It takes great pictures.CONS: the Face ID feature needs works, It failed,when my twin bother broke into my phone.  This security SUXS!  The is useless, I disabled this function and password function is abled.   This has problems with oled screen, everything burns straight the screen, screen saver is must on this.  I want iPhone X Plus version.Read full review...
Love this phone. Specially the long battery life and face ID.
Based from what I have read, it is a very good cp. I sent it to my niece in the Philippines so I can't tell how really good this cp is.My niece loves it very much and based from that I would say it is a very good cp.Read full review...
I put my Verizon SIM card in right after a reset. The phone showed some signal bars for less than 10 seconds and then disappeared. I even took it to a Verizon store, and they didn't even know why. Wasting your time and mine.Read full review...
Really quick and Face ID is very handy.
Well here the thing.. I have A lot to learn. But my kid had a emergency, her car broke down in the middle of nowhere... so I learned about location sharing. She talks about a lot it can do.. so I have much to learn.Read full review...
This iPhone X is incredibly fast! It's probably the best iPhone Apple has made so far! I love how huge this screen is and how durable it is as well! Thank you Apple!
I bought this in 2019. It didn't get bad just because the XS came out. In some ways it is better than my XS Max in that I don't have the same connectivity issues with this SOC. Well worth it in 2019 especially if you can get one for around $700.Read full review...
Phone was exactly as advertised. Works great and is in excellent condition.
Best thing I did this year sweet phone
Love my new IPhone X!!!!
I needed to find something out about this product and as soon as I sent him a message he replied within the hour. Very responsive. 
I wasn't sure the whole FaceID thing was going to work so well - my main concern was that Id have to hold the handset up to my face just to unlock. Luckily thats not the case and it does work off-angle very well.Swiping up instead of a home button isnt an issue for me. It's just different rather than better or worse.Display is gorgeous, everything else is the same as an 8+ but when I look back at any phone with a 'chin and button' it sort of looks pointless now. If you get one, you'll know what I mean :)Read full review...
Yep, quite an interesting experience getting to know the iPhone X.  I like the smaller overall size for the larger screen and like some of the new ways of interacting with the phone via iOS 11.  I do like the 'double click' followed by facial recognition to ready the phone for apple pay - I was always getting the fingerprint bit wrong.Oh, and very prompt and well packaged delivery from the suppliers.Read full review...
This phone has all the iPhone X attributes but at a much lower cost! To all intents and purposes it is just the same as a brand new phone. The delivery was quick and the packaging very secure. To say I am delighted with it would be a gross understatement.Read full review...
Good performance with an excellent screen, but you do pay the "Apple Premium" for this device.At full price this is a very expensive phone, and I personally would not pay over a PS1,000.00 to own one.But at just over PS800.00 and in mint condition this was a no-brainer.The battery life could be better but I do get over a days general use out of it, and with cordless charging it simply sits on its charger while I'm on the computer and is ready to go when I am.Its also just a bit bigger than my 6s used to be so I am still getting used to the larger feel. But of course the bonus here is the spectacularly good large screen.All in all I am very pleased with my purchase.Read full review...
This phone is perfect, you could look at it and think it's brand new.
Delighted with my iPhone 10 learned how to use it as different from iPhone 6plus. Lighter and battery lasts longer. Super camera too.
Just received the phone and its like a brand new . Nothing wrong with it absolutely perfect and I'm glad to make such this nice purchase. Thanks a lot...
I am really happy with IPhone X. Doing good quality pictures and that what I was looking for in my new phone.
Face recognition whoopee not a lot different to iPhone 7 Plus 256gb will not upgrade anymore Apple have had too much money out of me over the years I have iPad Air 2 and iApple Watch 2
Perfect condition! No tell tale signs of use (not even the typical phone case wear and tear)
Great phone, better camera than the iphone 7. Like the face recognition to access the phone instead of a finger print.
Really impressed with this phone. Switched from android after 6 years and no regrets. Compact, stylish and easy to use. Great phone all round
Excellent iphone,clean with no marks,excellent condition!
Really smart phone only two minor defects overall very pleased
Great item. Its got everything whats needed. Simple to use and beautyifuly designed.
Great productGreat conditionGreat price
Thank you so much for the iPhone i love it excellent condition and in good condition.
Brilliant love it
This iPhone X is so fast and compact love it
Got the quality product with special delivery. All accessories included as per pictures. Value for money! 5+ starssssss
Was under the impression it would be new, turns out the phone is already 1 year old and was previously owned. Description reads light scuffs and scratch's, but there was a noticeably deep Scratch on the screen, other then that the phone is great, shipping was fast camera quality is great, long battery life. If your coming from the iPhone 6 or earlier generations and looking to upgrade, I would definitely recommend this phone.Read full review...
I am happy with this new phone. The display is more vibrant,battery life is longer, and it's very fast. I love the new Face ID and animjois.
A big upgrade from the iPhone 7! Love the phone. Display is great. Battery life could be better but it can last you almost a full day. Would recommend if you are upgrading from a 7plus or under.
This is the best, by far, iPhone I have owned yet. It is so intelligent, yet sleek, but with a larger screen.  The color dynamics are incredible as is the camera and all the new features it has to offer. Worth EVERY penny.Read full review...
This phone was sweet. I am always worried about buying phones online cause I can't ever trust if they will work. The phone got to me 4 days earlier than originally listed. It works perfect and is exactly as described.Read full review...
It looked brand new no scratches or dents and it was truly unlocked for GSM
I was very pleased to receive my NEW10, Apple product never makes me wonder why, did I buy this. This thing is AWESOME!!!!!!
I love it, excellent deal for the price, actually my wife got another one! :)
Such a nice product and not just that, the personal attend your really good. Thank you so much for your help and everything.
5star dealer! Definitely recomment mywit team. Good responses, also good products.
I love it, the features and camera are amazing.
It'a great. Thanks:)
Waited a while for this phone, from 5s to X is a huge change. Never bother getting the ones in between for the reason that they slighty changed. Definitely X is a good phone. Feels right, performs right, looks good. Worth the money.Read full review...
Nice doing bussiness with you sir
I've just received one as birthday gift. Sorry to decline this
I'm impressed with the quality of the product. I am really satisfied with the phone, thanks a lot!
I appreciate your help and thank you so much
pleasure to do business with you,
Its condition is really new! I love it :)
No problems. Looked brand new ! Popped sims card in and was good to go
Got this to replace my iPhone 6 that I've had for over 4 years. Definitely worth the upgrade the difference is night and day. Couldn't be happier with the purchase.
Works perfectly. Had a little trouble getting to know the phone to power it properly but no defects with the phone. It is 100% authentic and of working value. Thanks bud!
Is perfect. Great condition...NEW...but came with a Samsung charging cable instead 8 pins iphone cable. Does not come with the bluetooth EarPods either. But generaly speaking, was a good deal.
Great condition! Accurate item description, comes with everything and some things more than on photos!!! 100% recommended
I bought an iphone x it was just what i expected!!! Everything is working and fine!
perfect great camera and fast processor
Absolutely love it!
Grate iPhone X I loved!!
Perfect conditions, good quality
works great
Great phone with great photos!
Great phone as described.
Great item!!!
Loving the iPhone X. 
Wasn't mint condition has a lot of scratches
Really good phone, had a couple of system issues but other than that I'm impressed with it. Tried to go to Android but couldn't do it! iPhone FTW!
Best iPhone I have ever owned I had the Samsung Galaxy S8 after owning the full range of iPhones then came back to Apple for the X which I am really happy about.
Phone came quick and brand new in the box with the seal and everything. An o2 locked phone costs about PS15 to unlock in a phone shop so I saved a lot of money.  Brilliant
Perfect and sealed in box. Thanks
Best iPhone yet! +++
I love the new feature of no home button. The screen quality is amazing, as well as the pictures you get from the camera.
Excellent iPhone with excellent features great graphics excellent
good condition and no reason it should be lower
Love it best phone ever
Thank you very much.Good qualityGood contact
Fast and overall amazing! Thank you!
Excellent . All around
