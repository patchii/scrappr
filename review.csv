Beware this may be a used phone pretending to be a new one	1.0 out of 5 stars	I would put a zero star rating if allowed.  I bought this a gift| only to find that during set up that the iPhone had already been owned by 2 other people with their IDs still hidden in the phone.  Apple support that nothing can be done to remove them from the phone without the password for those accounts - clearly that is never going to happen.  So I am now going to have to take this gift back and send it back to Amazon.  Hardly Christmas.  Completely unacceptable.
A solid phone| but an eyewatering price	4.0 out of 5 stars	It's a truly great phone| at a grossly inflated price. You would be foolish if you didn't think a large amount of what you are paying for is branding. Yes - you do get a lot of tech with this. And I find that even though some other phones are technically superior the iPhone seems to run better HOWEVER this is nearly one thousand pounds. That is a big investment - more than a laptop. If you can afford it| it won't disappoint but it's defiantly not that much better than the older versions which are 2/3 of the price.
Great brand new iPhone !	5.0 out of 5 stars	Really good iPhone ! Arrived way earlier than expected so quite pleased. The phone is brand new and is just amazing !
It’s a legit unopened I Phone X.	5.0 out of 5 stars	When I ordered this I was a bit skeptical due to the reviews. It arrived earlier than expected. It’s a legitimate I Phone X| not a fake or refurbished one. It also comes with headphones and a charger.
Genuine iPhone x	5.0 out of 5 stars	I received a genuine iPhone X| I was initially worried but on a second thought plus reviews; I decided to go for it. No disappointment| brand new phone and no problem.  Amazon called me to verify before authorising my purchase| even more better and more importantly cheap price I could get.
Excellent customer service	5.0 out of 5 stars	supplier is amazing. Received this phone before the due date which was amazing. Phone was brandnew unlocked in it’s original packaging:-) Phone is good but don’t think apple is worth the price tag in what it actually is.
Great phone at a decent price.	5.0 out of 5 stars	Purchased for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. Arrived quickly and although it was a grade A used item| couldn't find a mark on it!12 month warranty gives peace of mind too.
iPhoneX| at good price - love it.	5.0 out of 5 stars	It's an iPhoneX| at good price - love it.
